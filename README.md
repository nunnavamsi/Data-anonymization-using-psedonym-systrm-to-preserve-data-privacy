# Data-anonymization-using-psedonym-systrm-to-preserve-data-privacy

****OVERVIEW****



Each business or organization collects large data regularly. In this connection, cloud computing and wirelessnetwork 
infrastructure are often used. The use of such services requires less time to achieve the desired production, and users 
will also find it easier to manage jobs. 
To facilitate data storage in electronic databases, general services use a clear identity. Still, there may be some 
limitations and difficulties. Information such as a person's name, address, ID number, etc., can be linked to a unique 
identifier. Complete data can be stolen if an attacker manipulates a unique identifier. If necessary, attacks can be 
launched or estimated to obtain data. As a result, data privacy is not preserved sufficiently. 
Privacy problems in data should be assessed with all digital data storage. Given the circumstances, there is a good 
chance that sensitive information can fall into the wrong hands while transferring or using existing services. The 
information exchange process is also vulnerable to attacks on services, such as forgery and data breaches. 
To reduce these dangers, this research proposes a biometric authentication method that involves the use of apalmate. 
In addition, an approach to pseudonymization is used to ensure that data is properly preserved and stored 
anonymously in the database. In this approach, data and information are protected from illegal access. Users' real 
identities are never shared with third parties, according to the proposed approach, which addresses the issue of 
information leaks.

****SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS****



This includes database management systems (DBMS) or big data platforms like Hadoop or Spark, which offer scalable 
storage and processing capabilities. Additionally, specialized software for data integrity 
monitoring and analysis is essential, encompassing features such as real-time data 
monitoring, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition algorithms. Advanced encryption 
and cryptographic software ensure data security during transmission and storage, 
safeguarding against unauthorized access or tampering.
