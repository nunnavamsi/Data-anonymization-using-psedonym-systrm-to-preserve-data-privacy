# Data-anonymization-using-psedonym-systrm-to-preserve-data-privacy

****OVERVIEW****



Each business or organization collects large data regularly. In this connection, cloud computing and wirelessnetwork 
infrastructure are often used. The use of such services requires less time to achieve the desired production, and users 
will also find it easier to manage jobs. 
To facilitate data storage in electronic databases, general services use a clear identity. Still, there may be some 
limitations and difficulties. Information such as a person's name, address, ID number, etc., can be linked to a unique 
identifier. Complete data can be stolen if an attacker manipulates a unique identifier. If necessary, attacks can be 
launched or estimated to obtain data. As a result, data privacy is not preserved sufficiently. 
Privacy problems in data should be assessed with all digital data storage. Given the circumstances, there is a good 
chance that sensitive information can fall into the wrong hands while transferring or using existing services. The 
information exchange process is also vulnerable to attacks on services, such as forgery and data breaches. 
To reduce these dangers, this research proposes a biometric authentication method that involves the use of apalmate. 
In addition, an approach to pseudonymization is used to ensure that data is properly preserved and stored 
anonymously in the database. In this approach, data and information are protected from illegal access. Users' real 
identities are never shared with third parties, according to the proposed approach, which addresses the issue of 
information leaks.

****MODULES****

Register: using this module we will enter username, message and plam vein image as input and then apply above 9 points to generate PSEUDONYM  and then this values will be upload to DRIVEHQ cloud
Recognition: using this modules we will input user name and palm vein image and then application will generate PSEUDONYM  and this PSEUDONYM  will be compare with DRIVE HQ PSEUDONYM and if both PSEDONYM matched then user authenticated and then only user message will be displayed otherwise authentication will be failed and privacy to be user message will be provided![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1194d3b5-a699-4404-bda9-ad0d1a342279)
